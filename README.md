# Weather-Widget

## Overview
I am excited and proud to share you about my another milestone web-project **Weather Widget**.<br>
The project is built of mainly just three components, named as, *Search box*, *Search button* and *Weather card*.<br>
In this project, the user enters the location name in the search box, then click the search button or press the enter key on the keyboard, which displays the current weather information of that location in the form of card, with an example image of the weather of that location.
