# Weather-Widget

## Overview:
I am excited and proud to share you about my another milestone web-project **Weather Widget**.<br>
The project is built of mainly just three components, named as, *Search box*, *Search button* and *Weather card*.<br>
In this project, the user enters the location name in the search box, then click the search button or press the enter key on the keyboard, which displays the current weather information of that location in the form of card, with an example image of the weather of that location.

## Tech Deep-Dive:
I developed this project by using front-end technologies: *HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React & Material UI Library/Framework*.  
I used *Vite* tool to setup local environment for this React project.

## Note:
All the main files, which contains code of this project are in the *src* folder/directory.

## Development Journey:
